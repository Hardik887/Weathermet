# About the application
Weather forecasting is very necessary for our daily lives. 
<br></br>
It helps us to prepare and make plans depending on the expectations. Many weather stations are placed around the world fetching real-time weather elements’ data.
<br></br>
This data includes six elements, such as precipitation, wind, atmospheric pressure, cloudiness, and temperature. With these, you can analyze trends and know the prediction of tomorrow’s data or forecast the weather.
<br></br>
I have used the OpenWeatherMap API for this project.
<br></br>
It is built using NodeJS and RestAPI.
